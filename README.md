# Canvas Effects in JavaScript

This repository serves as a collection of various canvas effects implemented in JavaScript. These effects are curated from different sources and adapted for learning purposes.

## Overview

The examples in this repository demonstrate a range of canvas effects, including animations, visual manipulations, and graphical presentations. These effects are intended for educational purposes and to serve as a reference for implementing canvas-based features.

## Contents

The repository includes examples covering:

- **ASCII Art:** effect that translates images into ASCII characters, creating visual representations using text-based characters..
- **Pixel Rain:**  Load an image and generate a cascade of particles that form the image, slowing down their velocity as brighter colors emerge..
- **Particle Text:** Generate text using small particles, connecting them with lines based on proximity. On mouse hover, create a repelling effect on particles, returning to original positions when the mouse moves away.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```

```

Each effect is organized within its own directory and may include the necessary HTML, JavaScript, and assets required to showcase the effect.

## Usage

To view an effect:
1. Navigate to the respective effect's directory.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports HTML5 Canvas.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and learn from these examples. Contributions, improvements, and additional effects are welcome!
